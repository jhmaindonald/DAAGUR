## For more details, go to the PGRcode repository
This repository now serves mainly to redirect to https://jhmaindonald.github.io/PGRcode, 
which has code and other supplementary content that relates to the new text "A Practical 
Guide to Data Analysis Using R -- An Example-Based Approach", by John H Maindonald, 
W John Braun, and Jeffrey L Andrews. The new text is currently making its way through the 
Cambridge University Press copy-editing process, and is due for publication in May 2024.

## Extensive R language tutorial content is now available online

The third edition of _Data Analysis and Graphics Using R_ appeared in 2010. 
In view of the extensive R language tutorial content is now available online
it has now been judged appropriate to place the emphasis on R-based data 
analysis and associated graphics, and direct readers elsewhere for detailed
R language tutorial content. Some limited R tutorial content, together with 
R code from the text, is available from https://jhmaindonald.github.io/PGRcode,
with more toÂ be added in due course

## A New Text -- Building on "Data Analysis and Graphics Using R"

* Chapters 1--5 are now split between the new Chapters 1 and 2.
    * The section "A critique of p-value methodology" has been added.  
    * Bayes factors now get attention, used for the light that they shed on p-values.
    * There is extensive commentary on how issues with p-values play into the 
    reproducibility "crisis" in laboratory science. 
    * The discussion of multiple comparisons has been extended somewhat, with attention given to the "false detection rate", and to the use of the Benjamini-Hochberg approach when there are many p-values. (This is further taken up in Section 9.3 on RNA-Seq gene expression.  
* Chapter 3 has more extended commentary on the use of population-based data for inference.

More to come . . .
