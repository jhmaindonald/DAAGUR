## A New Text -- Building on "Data Analysis and Graphics Using R"

The third edition of _Data Analysis and Graphics Using R_ appeared
in 2010. Quite a bit has changed since then.  One big change is that
there is now extensive online tutorial material.  It is thus now 
appropriate to place the emphasis on R-based data analysis and
associated graphics, expecting that readers will look elsewhere
for R tutorial content, some of which we plan to make available
on this site.  We plan to provide more detail in the months to come.

## New Text vs "Data Analysis and Graphics Using R"

* Chapters 1--5 are now split between the new Chapters 1 and 2.
    * The section "A critique of p-value methodology" has been added.  
    * Bayes factors now get attention, used for the light that they shed on p-values.
    * There is extensive commentary on how issues with p-values play into the 
    reproducibility "crisis" in laboratory science. 
    * The discussion of multiple comparisons has been extended somewhat, with attention given to the "false detection rate", and to the use of the Benjamini-Hochberg approach when there are many p-values. (This is further taken up in Section 9.3 on RNA-Seq gene expression.  
* Chapter 3 has more extended commentary on the use of population-based data for inference.

More to come . . .
